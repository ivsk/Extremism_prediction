# Prediction_extremism

The purpose of the present project was to use machine learning to predict violent and nonviolent actions of domestic extremists from an open-source collection of data that contains individual-level information on the backgrounds, attributes, and radicalization processes of over 2200 extremist individuals.
The dataset is maintained by the University of Maryland and can be reached via the following website: https://www.start.umd.edu/data-tools/profiles-individual-radicalization-united-states-pirus
